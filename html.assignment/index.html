                    My name is <em>Archit Krishna </em>. I was born on july 24 <sup> th </sup>  2003 .  I am an international student
                     studing the <b>interactive media design </b>  at <abbr title="ALGONQUIN COLLEGE OTTAWA ">ACO</abbr>.
                    I want to become a <em> media architect</em> and start up my own company.
                    I want to train myself to be<b> imaginative and artistic</b>,
                    I want master the skill of communication and have enough courage to speak to a larger audience
                    and advertise my ideas and concepts to the public.

                <p>
                    I come from india at a state called <b>kerala</b> . it  is known for its backwaters and it's <em>wonderfull and aesthetic</em>
                    beaches. fun fact about kerala, it is the most<em> literate state in all of india</em>. I have always imagined my life to go according to 
                    plan if i study in a foreign country, its pretty difficult to live alone and im trying to try my level best to suceed in life.
