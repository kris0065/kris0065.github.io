            <p>Cameras have had a significant impact on people's lives since their invention. They allow us to capture
                and preserve memories in a visual format, making it easier to share important events and milestones with
                family and friends. Cameras have also revolutionized the way we communicate and share information, with
                social media and messaging apps making it easy to share photos and videos with others around the world.
                They have also played a crucial role in documenting historical events and raising awareness about
                important issues. With the rise of digital cameras and smartphones, photography has become more
                accessible to everyone, allowing people to take high-quality photos and share them instantly with
                others. The popularity of the selfie has also changed the way people express themselves and connect with
                others. Overall, cameras have had a profound impact on our lives and will continue to shape our
                experiences in the future.</p>

            <h2>TYPES</h2>
            <!-- Unordered list of types -->
            <ul>
                <li>DSLR cameras: DSLR (digital single-lens reflex) cameras are popular among professional photographers
                    due to their versatility and image quality. These cameras use a mirror and prism system to reflect
                    the image from the lens onto the camera's sensor, allowing for high-quality images.</li>
                <li>Point-and-shoot cameras: Point-and-shoot cameras are compact and easy to use, making them a popular
                    choice for casual photographers. They are typically small and lightweight, making them easy to carry
                    around. These cameras usually have automatic settings for exposure and focus, allowing for quick and
                    easy snapshots.</li>
                <li>Mirrorless cameras: Mirrorless cameras are similar to DSLR cameras, but they do not have a mirror
                    and prism system. Instead, they use an electronic viewfinder to display the image from the camera's
                    sensor. This allows for a more compact and lightweight camera body, while still maintaining high
                    image quality. Mirrorless cameras are becoming increasingly popular among both amateur and
                    professional photographers.
