            <h2>Information on the Arctic Monkeys</h2>
            <img src="images/artic-monkeys.jpg" alt="band" width="150" height="150">
            Arctic Monkeys are an English rock band formed in Sheffield in 2002. The group consists of Alex Turner (lead
            vocals, guitar, keyboards), Jamie Cook (guitar, keyboards), Nick O'Malley (bass guitar, backing vocals), and
            Matt Helders (drums, backing vocals). Former band member Andy Nicholson (bass guitar, backing vocals) left
            the band in 2006 shortly after their debut album was released.
            Arctic Monkeys were heralded as one of the first bands to come to public attention via the Internet,
            with commentators suggesting they represented the possibility of a change in the way in which new bands are
            promoted and marketed.[2] Their debut album, Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not (2006), became
            the fastest-selling debut album in UK chart history, and has been hailed as one of the greatest debut
            albums.[3] It won Best British Album at the 2007 Brit Awards. The band's second album,
            Favourite Worst Nightmare (2007), was also acclaimed by critics and won Best British Album at the 2008 BRIT
            Awards. They went on to release Humbug (2009) and Suck It and See (2011).

            <li>Radiohead’s Thom Yorke hit out against the band’s success, saying: “The fact that (the) poor Arctic
                Monkeys are getting so much attention is purely based on the fact that the mainstream music business is
                such a bunch of fucking retards as far as I’m concerned.”</li>
            <li>The Kills’ Alison Mosshart helped write (and provides backing vocals for) ‘Humbug’s ‘The Fire And The
                Thud’.</li>
